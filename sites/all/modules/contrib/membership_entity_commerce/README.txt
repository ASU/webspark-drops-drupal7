CONTRIBUTIONS AND FEATURE REQUESTS
----------------------------------
Issues and feature requests should be reported at
https://drupal.org/project/issues/2211367.

Issues will be reviewed as quickly as is reasonable with the understanding that
the maintainers have personal and professional responsibilities outside of this
module.

Feature requests will generally only be developed as the need arises for
paying clients. However, if you write a feature and submit a patch it will
gladly be considered for inclusion in the module.
