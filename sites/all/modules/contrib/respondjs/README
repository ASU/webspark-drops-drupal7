Respond.js is a polyfill for CSS3 media queries. It allows
browsers without native MQ support to have a rudimentary
ability to process CSS wrapped in max- and min-width MQs.

This module adds respond.js in a responsible manner:

* Respond.js will never be preprocessed or aggregated.
* Respond.js will come after CSS
* Respond.js should come before most other scripts, with
  exceptions for Modernizr or other scripts that might
  provide presentational benefits deemed more important
  than the IE userbase. We won't judge you :)
* As of 7.x-1.1 you can choose where you'd like the
  library to appear (header or footer). Defaults to header.

Installing the library:

* Download the library from https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond
* Add this folder with the name 'respondjs' in your libraries folder
  e.g. sites/all/libraries
* Check the Status Report page if the library is succesfully installed
