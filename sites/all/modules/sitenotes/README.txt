The SiteNotes module is simple in structure.

* It creates a new content type, called a "Site Note."  It has standard configuration options.
* It puts a menu item in the Admin >> Site Building menu so you can list out the notes.
* It shows a teaser list of all the notes with a "read more" link if they are bigger than the teaser length.
* It creates an entry in the Access Control list so you can limit permissions to see/use it.
* It has a "Recent Site Notes" block, with configuration.
* It allows Site Notes to be exposed or hidden for Search.

Why would I want to use it?

* "How To" notes for your client.
* Track CSS changes.
* Track custom code, such as theme modules.
* Reminders of how to do something you don't do often enough to remember exactly.
* Billing notes.
* To Do lists for admins.
* Succession notes for the next webmaster.
* Use your imagination!

The Sitenotes module does have an uninstall feature.  It will delete all nodes created with the module as well as the "sitenotes" content type.  It also removes variables and blocks created by the module.

You might want to add ".sitenotes-recent-info {text-align: right;}" to your CSS if you use the block.
