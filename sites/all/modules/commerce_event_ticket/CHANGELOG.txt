Commerce Event Ticket 7.x-1.x-dev, 2014-07-05
-----------------------
 * Renamed cet_services module to commerce_event_ticket_services.

Commerce Event Ticket 7.x-1.x-dev, 2014-07-04
-----------------------
 * Permissions for tickets related to *products* the user may edit have now been
   removed. Instead, there are permissions for tickets related to *nodes* that
   the user may edit.

Commerce Event Ticket 7.x-1.x-dev, 2014-06-26
-----------------------
 * There is now a default Rule (enabled by default) in the
   commerce_event_ticket_mail submodule called "Send the tickets to the
   customer". Visit admin/config/workflow/rules to change this (if rules_admin
   is enabled).

Commerce Event Ticket 7.x-1.x-dev, 2014-06-25
-----------------------
 * E-mail functionality has been removed from the _pdf submodule and moved into
   commerce_event_ticket_mail. If you have been using e-mails, you will need to
   enable the commerce_event_ticket_mail module, and reconfigure your Rules.
 * It's now possible to configure one e-mail with different content depending
   on whether the message will have any tickets. So the Rules action "Send an
   order's tickets by e-mail as attachments" could be used to send a
   general-purpose order confirmation e-mail, whether or not tickets are
   attached.

Commerce Event Ticket 7.x-1.x-dev, 2014-06-19
-----------------------
 * Added the default field, 'cet_enable', to product types. This is now used to
   determine whether a product is enabled to have tickets.
 * Renamed the function commerce_event_ticket_product_is_ticket() to
   commerce_event_ticket_product_enabled().
 * Renamed hook_commerce_event_ticket_product_is_ticket_alter() to
   hook_commerce_event_ticket_product_enabled_alter() (see
   commerce_event_ticket.api.php).
