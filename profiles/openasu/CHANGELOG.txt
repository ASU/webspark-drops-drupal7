Webspark 1.43 (Colorado) release, 2017-16-05
--------------------------------------------
- Webspark core 

    * Drupal core (v7.54) - This includes security and non-security updates, including:
        * Old module cruft cleanup - Background: Drupal 7.50+ has a new check for erroneous entries that remain
          in the Drupal database system table when a previously enabled module's code is deleted without going through
          the proper disable/uninstall process (usually if the module had an .install file with hook_uninstall in it.)
          Webspark will start throwing new errors for logged-in site administrators in those cases. To get rid of these
          error messages, go to /admin/reports/status and look for "Missing Module" instructions to follow.
        * Some iframe tags will now work (as long as the iframe is pulling content from the SAMEORIGIN).
    * Panopoly (v1.43) - Includes a security update to Views (v3.15), as well as updates to all of its core modules.
      See https://www.drupal.org/project/panopoly/releases/7.x-1.43 for details.
    * Webspark Featurescustom (v1.6) - Remove LOW warning-triggering comments from Webspark JS files to help
      reduce LOW RiskSense warnings from security remediation scans.

    * ASU Directory Integration Reinvented (v-1.7)
        * Automatic integration with ASU Local iSearch Directory (ASU LID) module (if enabled)
            * When ASU LID is enabled, and profiles have been imported from iSearch, the directory listings will automatically link to the imported profile nodes.
            * Now includes a Solr Health Check fallback. If Solr is down, then the directory listing will automatically be replaced with a Drupal View of local profile profile nodes
            * Form fields and directory will now respect ASU LID-style expertise and local tag settings, if applicable
            * Added option to 'Always Use Local iSearch View', which will always use the ASU LID view instead of Solr view
            * Added customizable sort option, allowing switching between iSearch customized sorting, and local iSearch imported
    	    * Configuration management improved to allow interchanging of configs with ASU LID module

            * Automatic profile updating
            * Profiles are updated from iSearch via periodic cron tasks
            * Periodic and load-time checking of profiles against iSearch Solr index, to ensure up-to-date affiliation data
            * ASU LID Profile List View will automatically substitute for the ASU DIR Solr listings if iSearch Solr health check fails
    * ASU Brand (v1.15)
        * Now updates theme_default value regardless of whether the module is part of Webspark or not.
    * ASU Spotlight (v1.6.1)
        * Fix for update hook which resulted in revision table not being updated
        * Added width:100%; to the blurbcontainer class in asuflex.css for IE 9+ users.
    * Webspark Jumbohero (v1.2-dev)
        * Fixed missing blurb and buttons issue (only the title field's contents were showing).
    * Webspark Content Callout (v1.5-dev)
        * Move Webspark Seven JS code out and into Webspark Seven theme.
    * Webspark Extras (v1.6)
        * Added web standard QuickTab style
    * Innovation theme (v1.9)
        * Label tags for form elements now properly clear left when the label text is only a single line in the browser window (Chrome and IE issue).

        * Fixed layout option buttons bottom border for ASU Degrees listings.

- Webspark-managed contrib modules & libraries

    * Contrib projects – Additions
        * Missing Module - Helps facilitate removing missing Drupal projects that create error messages.

- Webspark custom projects - Changes/Deletions

    * ASU Security Scan Fixes - Removed JS file that kept Webspark from using iframe tags.
      (This is now handled in Drupal core with a SAMEORIGIN HTTP header.)
    * ASU Webspark Bootstrap theme and library - The original (and non-standards compliant) Webspark theme
      (asu_webspark_bootstrap) have been completely removed from Webspark. IMPORTANT: If your site is still
      running this theme and using its accompanying Bootstrap library, do not update Webspark until you have moved
      your site to a Web standards compliant theme (like Innovation).



Webspark 1.40.3 (Shell Valley) release, 2017-15-02

        * The "Available Updates" list no longer incorrectly and confusingly lists any LDAP modules as needing updates

    * Innovation theme (v1.8)
        * Updated all layout TPLs to remote <section> tags and replace them with <div class="section"> tag.
            * IMPORTANT for Innovation subtheme users: Be sure to review your subtheme CSS files for any
              "section" CSS selectors and replace "section" with "div.section" - and thoroughly test your changes
              before pushing up to production. Barring any namespacing issues, subtheme ".section" CSS class
              selectors should still work.
        * In-Page Editor selections now properly displays eligible content panes again when the "+" button is
          clicked and a subcategory (such as "Views", "Blocks", etc.) is selected

Webspark 1.27 (Montana) release (MAJOR Update), 2016-17-06
----------------------------------------------------------
- Webspark core
    * Updated Panopoly core - v1.27
        * The Panopoly layout templates (which were part of the Kalatheme theme) were upgraded from their custom Panopoly layouts to Radix layouts. Any Webspark site pages/sections should be updated automatically to the new Radix layouts while keeping the same look/feel.
        * Fixed template naming bug affecting the Brown layout. If you are using the Brown layout for any content on your site, that content will likely need to be manually moved to the equivalent regions after updating.
        * When choosing new page layouts anywhere in the Drupal UI, avoid using any layouts that are listed under the "Panopoly" category and are now labeled as "deprecated". (TIP: The Radix layout icons in various Drupal UI sections are purple, while the old, deprecated layout icons are black.)
        * While the CSS classes were (mostly) ported from the old layouts, there are a couple of slight DOM changes. Therefore, any sites with subthemes should thoroughly check to ensure that their site's customization is still rendering properly.
        * Several contrib modules have been updated to versions tested to work with Panopoly 1.27.

        * Fixed issue with the menu overlaying IPE elements
    * ASU RFI (v1.4)
        * Implemented updated email response templates

Webspark 1.13.15 (Bellingham) release, 2016-28-04
-------------------------------------------------
- Drupal core:
    * The update to Drupal 7.43 broke file uploads attached to all Drupal forms submitted by unauthenticated users when
    form validation fails. A temporary patch to fix this regression has been applied until the issue is fixed in Drupal
    core.

- Webspark core:
    * Added 1 hour of caching (vs. none) for 301 page redirects to speed up their processing for repeat visitors
    * Updated all Webspark maroon, gold, and blue colors in various CSS files to match Brand Guide defined ASU colors

- Contrib libraries in Webspark:
    * CAS (v1.3.4) - Includes multiple bug fixes and improvements (phpCAS changelog)

- Custom ASU modules in Webspark:

  The following deprecated Webspark modules/components (all of which are listed under "DEPRECATED" in the admin/modules
  page of your site) have been removed in this release:
    * ASU Eadvisor Feed Feature (replaced by ASU Degrees)
    * ASU News (replaced by Webspark News & Events)
    * ASU Events (replaced by Webspark News & Events)

      While we strongly recommend discontinuing use of these unsupported projects in favor of their replacements, they
      can technically be kept in your website by copying the module directories into the sites/all/modules folder of
      your Webspark and immediately visiting the main modules page (i.e. /admin/modules) of your Webspark site before
      this update is applied.

- Web standards components in Webspark:
    * Innovation theme (v1.0)
        * Added "Skip to Content" link in template.php (accessibility fix)
        * Fixed bottom margin issue with ASU Spotlight panes (was too large)
    * Webspark News & Events (v1.0-beta3)
        * Added ability to process new feed formats from ASU Now and ASU Events. To enable processing of the new feed
          formats, follow the updating instructions at: https://webspark.asu.edu/features/news-and-events#updating
        * Created new fields and instances to fix conflicts in the field schema change needed to import the new ASU Now
          and ASU Event feeds
        * Updated field mappings in standalone import form
        * Fixed minor spelling issue in module description

        * IMPORTANT: If you have this module enabled and have already created events and/or news items, then you must
        delete all of them prior to applying this update. This includes all non-feed generated events or news items
        have been created manually. Please read the "Update" section of ASU News & Events
        (https://webspark.asu.edu/features/news-and-events#updating) for detailed steps on how to apply this update.

    * Webspark Megamenu (v1.6)
        * Megamenu javascript files are now only called when the Innovation theme is the active theme on the page (was
          being called for all Drupal themes)
        * Reconfigured Megamenu javascript so that it is included in Drupal's JS aggregation (for better performance)
        * Implemented new web standards styling for Megamenu items with expanded submenus.

        IMPORTANT: Sites that have previously customized the CSS styling of their expanded submenus may need to make
        adjustments to their custom styling and should test before deploying this update to their live/production
        sites: https://webspark.asu.edu/features/mega-menu#updating
