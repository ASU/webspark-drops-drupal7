    * Innovation theme (v1.2)

Webspark 1.27 (Montana) release (MAJOR Update)
----------------
- Webspark core
    * Updated Panopoly core - v1.27
        * The Panopoly layout templates (which were part of the Kalatheme theme) were upgraded from their custom Panopoly layouts to Radix layouts. Any Webspark site pages/sections should be updated automatically to the new Radix layouts while keeping the same look/feel.
        * Fixed template naming bug affecting the Brown layout. If you are using the Brown layout for any content on your site, that content will likely need to be manually moved to the equivalent regions after updating.
        * When choosing new page layouts anywhere in the Drupal UI, avoid using any layouts that are listed under the "Panopoly" category and are now labeled as "deprecated". (TIP: The Radix layout icons in various Drupal UI sections are purple, while the old, deprecated layout icons are black.)
        * While the CSS classes were (mostly) ported from the old layouts, there are a couple of slight DOM changes. Therefore, any sites with subthemes should thoroughly check to ensure that their site's customization is still rendering properly.
        * Several contrib modules have been updated to versions tested to work with Panopoly 1.27.

        * Fixed issue with the menu overlaying IPE elements
    * ASU RFI (v1.4)
        * Implemented updated email response templates
        * RFI submission statuses now change on submission, rather than on callback from the middleware
        * The domain is now collected on form submission rather than on a middleware post
    * ASU Degrees (v1.9)

Webspark 1.13.15 (Bellingham) release
----------------
- Drupal core:
    * The update to Drupal 7.43 broke file uploads attached to all Drupal forms submitted by unauthenticated users when
    form validation fails. A temporary patch to fix this regression has been applied until the issue is fixed in Drupal
    core.

- Webspark core:
    * Added 1 hour of caching (vs. none) for 301 page redirects to speed up their processing for repeat visitors
    * Updated all Webspark maroon, gold, and blue colors in various CSS files to match Brand Guide defined ASU colors

- Contrib libraries in Webspark:
    * CAS (v1.3.4) - Includes multiple bug fixes and improvements (phpCAS changelog)

- Custom ASU modules in Webspark:

  The following deprecated Webspark modules/components (all of which are listed under "DEPRECATED" in the admin/modules
  page of your site) have been removed in this release:
    * ASU Eadvisor Feed Feature (replaced by ASU Degrees)
    * ASU News (replaced by Webspark News & Events)
    * ASU Events (replaced by Webspark News & Events)

      While we strongly recommend discontinuing use of these unsupported projects in favor of their replacements, they
      can technically be kept in your website by copying the module directories into the sites/all/modules folder of
      your Webspark and immediately visiting the main modules page (i.e. /admin/modules) of your Webspark site before
      this update is applied.

- Web standards components in Webspark:
    * Innovation theme (v1.0)
        * Added "Skip to Content" link in template.php (accessibility fix)

    * Webspark News & Events (v1.0-beta3)
        * Added ability to process new feed formats from ASU Now and ASU Events. To enable processing of the new feed
          formats, follow the updating instructions at: https://webspark.asu.edu/features/news-and-events#updating
        * Created new fields and instances to fix conflicts in the field schema change needed to import the new ASU Now
          and ASU Event feeds
        * Updated field mappings in standalone import form
        * Fixed minor spelling issue in module description

        * IMPORTANT: If you have this module enabled and have already created events and/or news items, then you must
        delete all of them prior to applying this update. This includes all non-feed generated events or news items
        have been created manually. Please read the "Update" section of ASU News & Events
        (https://webspark.asu.edu/features/news-and-events#updating) for detailed steps on how to apply this update.

    * Webspark Megamenu (v1.6)
        * Megamenu javascript files are now only called when the Innovation theme is the active theme on the page (was
          being called for all Drupal themes)
        * Reconfigured Megamenu javascript so that it is included in Drupal's JS aggregation (for better performance)
        * Implemented new web standards styling for Megamenu items with expanded submenus.

        IMPORTANT: Sites that have previously customized the CSS styling of their expanded submenus may need to make
        adjustments to their custom styling and should test before deploying this update to their live/production
        sites: https://webspark.asu.edu/features/mega-menu#updating
