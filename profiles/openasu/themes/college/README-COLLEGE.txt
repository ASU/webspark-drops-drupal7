Like the Innovation theme, the College theme includes Bootstrap 3.1.0.2, to match up with OpenASU's version.

Unlike the Innovation theme, however, this theme used Bootstrap-SASS came from https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/tree/3.1-stable

It was installed via Compass without Gemfile: compass create my-new-project -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap

The command-line command "compass watch" will compile the SASS. Read the README.md file at https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/tree/v3.1.0%2B2 for more

The HOWTO installation steps are also in /sites/all/themes/README-CUSTOMIZING-WS2.0-THEMING.txt.
