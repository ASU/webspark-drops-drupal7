# ASU Request for Information Changelog

### ASU RFI 7.x-3.3, 2020-06-09
- The RFI module settings now correctly block the resubmissions of older, locally-saved RFI submissions as originally intended.
- Locally-saved copies of RFI submissions are now deleted 45 days after their initial submission, up from 14 days.
- Added option to manually set the RFI submission retention time.
- Standalone RFI forms now auto-update the campus options based on the degree selected.

### ASU RFI 7.x-3.2, 2020-05-28
- Fixed issue that was blocking the processing of production RFI submissions on sites hosted outside the ASU network
 (e.g., Pantheon hosted sites). All RFI form submissions once again submit to the RFI middleware when the module is set
  to production mode. Those submissions that had their status incorrectly set to ‘CANCELLED’ will be resubmitted and sent
  onto the middleware with the next cron run.

### ASU RFI 7.x-3.1, 2020-05-15
- Reverted changes to test mode in the previous release that broke the RFI module's ability to 1) source the term start
  dates, campuses, countries, and states option lists, and 2) submit test submissions for non production websites hosted
  outside the ASU network. Test mode works again as expected in those cases
- Updated the RFI Submission Status field labels/values to better differentiate between Salesforce integration and middleware
  integration
- Updated documentation in both the README.md file and the RFI settings form to reflect these changes
- The Online campus, "not yet online", error (visible only to administrators) now defaults to hidden -
  and can be toggled on/off in the RFI. The error's purpose has also been clarified in its own messaging.
- Updated, "This is in TEST MODE", messaging above forms when the site is in test mode
- Added error logging for when the Online campus programs feed is not working

- RFI configuration page improvements/fixes
    * Added new categories and moved existing settings, moved and collapsed rarely-used options at the bottom of the
      settings page to improve end-user experience
    * Added separate middleware environment selection option to the RFI configuration page for use within the ASU enterprise
      environment
    * Added basic ASU Enterprise webhosting availability checking for determining what middleware is available
    * Added new "None" option (on top of Test vs. Production) to allow no middleware delivery at all and to improve the
      submission posting code for better performance and organization

    * The automatic resubmission of failed RFI submissions and the deletion of qualifying RFI submissions (both via cron jobs) can be toggled on/off

- Form improvements
    * The major is now chosen automatically regardless of the RFI form type (works for both undergrad and graduate programs)
    * Added missing form field validation to email, phone number, and email fields
    * RFI blocks now display error messages (to admins only) with helper instructions for when the form isn't rendering within a correctly placed block on a degrees page

    * Updated ASU campus list options
    * Added better, "this program is not available", logic
    * Removed 'align="left|right|center"' <td> tag properties to improve accessibility.

##### Data Management

- Updated RFI submission deletion policies to adhere to the University Data Handling Standard.
    * Upon updating the module to this version, all submissions older than 14 days old upon updating the module, regardless of status
    * All submissions that have successfully been sent onto any Salesforce middleware are deleted upon every cron run
    * All submissions that have not been sent on (status SF_Failed) are resubmitted every time a cron job runs
    * All submissions that have failed for 14 days past the initial submission date are deleted at the next cron run - regardless of their status
