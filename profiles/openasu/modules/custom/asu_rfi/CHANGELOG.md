##### UI/UX Improvements

- RFI submission reports page improvements
    * Updated RFI submission status value options, and improved the related help text.
    * Reorganized the report's columns to put more relevant data up towards the front
    * Improved the messaging of the submission's current status for end users
    * Added a "Delete submissions" bulk operation option
    * Cleaned up the page theming

- RFI configuration page improvements/fixes
    * Added easier to find "RFI settings" admin menu link under "Configuration"
    * Reorganized the configuration form items into categories
    * Added dynamic messaging about middleware auth key status
    * Confirmation pages can now be selected via autocomplete on the page's title (vs. entering a raw node ID integer)
    * The automatic resubmission of failed RFI submissions and the deletion of qualifying RFI submissions (both via cron jobs) can be toggled on/off

- Form improvements
    * The major is now chosen automatically regardless of the RFI form type (works for both undergrad and graduate programs)
    * Added missing form field validation to email, phone number, and email fields
    * RFI blocks now display error messages (to admins only) with helper instructions for when the form isn't rendering within a correctly placed block on a degrees page

- Updated README documentation for end users

##### Data Management

- Updated RFI submission deletion policies to better adhere to UTO security and/or PII policies
    * Upon updating the module to this version, all submissions older than 14 days old upon updating the module, regardless of status
    * All submissions that have successfully been sent onto any Salesforce middleware are deleted upon every cron run
    * All submissions that have not been sent on (status SF_Failed) are resubmitted every time a cron job runs
    * All submissions that have failed for 14 days past the initial submission date are deleted at the next cron run - regardless of their status
