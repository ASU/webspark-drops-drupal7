# ASU Academic Programs module

* The ASU Academic Programs module is used to pull degree programs and certificates from webapp4 into a website.
* When enabled, the modules will create two content types (ASU Academic Programs and ASU Academic Programs Feed) and multiple Drupal Views to display the content.
* Upon import, ASU Academic Programs nodes will be created for each of the programs or certificates from the selected source.
* For more information on setting up the module, [see webspark.asu.edu](https://webspark.asu.edu).
