ASU Brand module - CHANGELOG

7.x-2.3 2021-03-12
------------------
- Upon logging in, CAS users now return to their last visited page (vs. the default home page).
- Added configuration to toggle the above described behavior on/off under the WS2.0 Header block settings

7.x-2.2 2021-02-24
------------------
- Rolled back hook_update_7202 that deletes old, legacy students footer block

7.x-2.1 2020-10-28
-------------------
- Multiple long tab names may cause response issues on desktop

7.x-2.0 2020-10-28
-------------------
- Integrated the ASU global header preact web component (v1.1.13) to
  provide the Web Standards 2 mobile universal header when the College
  theme is set
- Added Web Standards 2 theming for the ASU global footer
- Added new parent organization and department URL fields to the header
  block configuration form to generate the parent unit link in the ASU
  global header when those values are set
- Added SASS for CSS management
- Added logic to detect when the Innovation or College theme is set to
  determine which header/footer blocks to enable/disable when the theme is
  changed
- Hid ASU Brand configuration form from Webspark installs because those
  settings are now automatically set based on which web standards theme is
  set as the default. The configuration form remains available for
  non-Webspark installs.

7.x-1.21 2020-03-20
-------------------
- Added drupal_alter to allow dynamic customization and theming of site menu before it is passed to the header

7.x-1.20 2019-10-09
-------------------
- Added check for asu_brand_ci_testing variable which will disable cookie consent for Travis-CI testing

7.x-1.19 2017-11-09
-------------------
- Added ability to specify parent org. title and URL on the ASU Brand Header block config form

7.x-1.18 2017-11-09
-------------------
- Fixed the 'do not override' list to use js instead of relying on the hosts header

7.x-1.17 2017-08-07
-------------------
- Set brand header default version to 'stable', and also set header selection to 'stable' upon update

7.x-1.16 2017-05-23
-------------------
- Added 'asu_brand_do_not_override' variable. This is a JSON-encoded array of host names. If the requested host is found
  in the list, the brand module will not pass in the CAS authentication URL if the CAS module is enabled.
- Removed max version check

7.x-1.15 2017-03-22
-------------------
-Now updates theme_default value regardless of whether the module is part of Webspark or not.

7.x-1.14 2017-01-19
-------------------
- Added check to disable GTM script during testing to keep faulty stats out of GTM records and to fix testing issues
  introduced by GTM-injected content.

7.x-1.13 2016-08-11
-------------------
- Re-added max header version check

7.x-1.9, 2015-05-06
-------------------
- Updated default header version constant to 4.3

7.x-1.7, 2014-11-25
-------------------
- Google Tag Manager (GTM) Integration for analytics injection (reads new gtm.shtml
  file from includes folder).
- Header versions file changed to gtmheader.xml .
- Header versions file location is sensitive to set basepath.
- Checks for brand module version dependancy.
- Menu item json injects absolute paths.
- Removed extraneous properties from menu menu item json.

7.x-1.6, 2014-09-22
-------------------
- Removes use cas_login_destination() as it is not available as of cas-7.x-1.4.

7.x-1.5, 2014-01-15
-------------------
- Add the use of long term caches in the case that the external file resources
  are unavailable, including header version XML file.
- Added the ability to block certain paths from getting block's full content and
  just providing a 'Preview not available' message. This helps with panel pane
  previews throwing ajax errors. Provides default paths with option to add/delete
  paths through the UI.

7.x-1.4, 2013-03-27
-------------------
- Added support for selecting header version from http://asu.edu/asuthemes/headers.xml.

7.x-1.3, 2013-02-15
-------------------
- Fix signin/signout urls by using url() and setting destination query parameter
  with destination building functions. This fixes non-root directory sites and
  sites behind a proxy server.

7.x-1.2, 2012-09-14
-------------------
- Split functions out into asu_brand.admin.inc and asu_brand.block.inc to
  decrease asu_brand.module file. This helps speed up loading page requests and
  is a best practice. Renamed _asu_brand_block_header() and
  _asu_brand_block_footer() to better represent what they do.
- Removed extra variable_del() in asu_brand_uninstall().
- Added block for students.asu.edu menu footer (located at
  http://www.asu.edu/asuthemes/4.0/includes/students_footer.shtml as of this
  release).
- Added asu_brand_cache_clear() to clear all asu_brand related cached items.
- Changed footer color options so that Black = '', which is the default and the
  actual value for the black footer. Made the color field on the block
  configuration form not required so that it will pass validation.
- Added the theme basepath to all block configuration forms.
- Fixed asu_brand_get_block_header() so as to not make unnecessary if
  statements.

7.x-1.1, 2012-07-23
-------------------
- Updated the module to work with the 4.0 version of the ASU header.

7.x-1.0, 2012-07-20
-------------------
- Initial non-beta release.
- Made https://asu.edu/asuthemes the default base path so the module will work
  out-of-box on hosting environments that do not have AFS access.
- Checks if theme files are able to be loaded. If there is already data in the
  cache, then just continue to use it.
- Added link to list of templates to the block configuration form.

7.x-1.0-beta3, 2012-03-22
-------------------------
- Include global $base_path in $asu_sso_signinurl and $asu_sso_signouturl for
  installations that are not in the root web directory.

7.x-1.0-beta2, 2012-01-03
-------------------------
- Update Sign Out link when CAS is not enabled.
- Remove WebAuth compatibility since this module is for drupal 7 sites
and WebAuth won't be supported for drupal 7.
- Fix bug where if you changed the footer color to something other
than black and then back to black, a warning to enter a color value was triggered.

7.x-1.0-beta1, 2011-09-22
-------------------------
- Initial beta release of the ASU Brand module.
