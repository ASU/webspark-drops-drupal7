CHANGELOG for ASU Brand module for Drupal 7

7.x-1.7, 2014-11-25
-----------------------
- Google Tag Manager (GTM) Integration for analytics injection (reads new gtm.shtml
  file from includes folder).
- Header versions file changed to gtmheader.xml .
- Header versions file location is sensitive to set basepath.
- Checks for brand module version dependancy.
- Menu item json injects absolute paths.
- Removed extraneous properties from menu menu item json.

7.x-1.6, 2014-09-22
-----------------------
- Removes use cas_login_destination() as it is not available as of cas-7.x-1.4.

7.x-1.5, 2014-01-15
-----------------------
- Add the use of long term caches in the case that the external file resources
  are unavailable, including header version XML file.
- Added the ability to block certain paths from getting block's full content and
  just providing a 'Preview not available' message. This helps with panel pane
  previews throwing ajax errors. Provides default paths with option to add/delete
  paths through the UI.

7.x-1.4, 2013-03-27
-----------------------
- Added support for selecting header version from http://asu.edu/asuthemes/headers.xml.

7.x-1.3, 2013-02-15
-----------------------
- Fix signin/signout urls by using url() and setting destination query parameter
  with destination building functions. This fixes non-root directory sites and
  sites behind a proxy server.

7.x-1.2, 2012-09-14
-----------------------
- Split functions out into asu_brand.admin.inc and asu_brand.block.inc to
  decrease asu_brand.module file. This helps speed up loading page requests and
  is a best practice. Renamed _asu_brand_block_header() and
  _asu_brand_block_footer() to better represent what they do.
- Removed extra variable_del() in asu_brand_uninstall().
- Added block for students.asu.edu menu footer (located at 
  http://www.asu.edu/asuthemes/4.0/includes/students_footer.shtml as of this
  release).
- Added asu_brand_cache_clear() to clear all asu_brand related cached items.
- Changed footer color options so that Black = '', which is the default and the
  actual value for the black footer. Made the color field on the block
  configuration form not required so that it will pass validation.
- Added the theme basepath to all block configuration forms.
- Fixed asu_brand_get_block_header() so as to not make unnecessary if
  statements.

7.x-1.1, 2012-07-23
-----------------------
- Updated the module to work with the 4.0 version of the ASU header.

7.x-1.0, 2012-07-20
-----------------------
- Initial non-beta release.
- Made https://asu.edu/asuthemes the default base path so the module will work
  out-of-box on hosting environments that do not have AFS access.
- Checks if theme files are able to be loaded. If there is already data in the
  cache, then just continue to use it.
- Added link to list of templates to the block configuration form.

7.x-1.0-beta3, 2012-03-22
-----------------------
- Include global $base_path in $asu_sso_signinurl and $asu_sso_signouturl for
  installations that are not in the root web directory.

7.x-1.0-beta2, 2012-01-03
-----------------------
- Update Sign Out link when CAS is not enabled.
- Remove WebAuth compatibility since this module is for drupal 7 sites
and WebAuth won't be supported for drupal 7.
- Fix bug where if you changed the footer color to something other
than black and then back to black, a warning to enter a color value was triggered.

7.x-1.0-beta1, 2011-09-22
-----------------------
- Initial beta release of the ASU Brand module.
