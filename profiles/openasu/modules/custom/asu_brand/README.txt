ASU Brand module installation instructions.

1. Install and enable the ASU Brand module just like any other module.
2. Go to the Structure -> Blocks and move the ASU Brand header and ASU Brand
   footer blocks into the header and footer regions respectively. The available
   regions will be determined by the theme that you are using.
3. The header and footer are cached locally and will refresh every 48 hours. If
   you need to manually refresh them, go to Configuration -> Performace and
   clear the site's cache.

  Header bottom: #ffcb66 (if you are using a gold header; #860025 for maroon)
