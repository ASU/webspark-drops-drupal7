Feature: Add media using the rich text editor
  In order to add visual interest to my pages
  As a site builder
  I need to be able to insert media using the WYSIWYG editor

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    When I visit "/node/add/panopoly-test-page"
      And I fill in the following:
        | Title  | Testing WYSIWYG       |
        | Editor | panopoly_wysiwyg_text |

  # For some inexplicable reason this is necessary on Travis-CI. Without it,
  # the first test always fails: it can't find the "Bryant Content" region.
  @api @chrome @panopoly_wysiwyg @panopoly_wysiwyg_image @panopoly_images @drupal_private_files
  Scenario: Fix issues on Travis-CI (on Chrome)
    # Normally, here we'd press "Publish", however some child distribtions
    # don't use 'save_draft', and this makes this test compatible with them.
    #When I press "Publish"
    When I press "edit-submit"

  # TODO: About 10% of the time this test will hang with Firefox, so for now,
  # we will run in Chrome only on Travis-CI to get consistent builds.

  Scenario: Upload an image with format and alt text
    When I type "Testing body" in the "edit-body-und-0-value" WYSIWYG editor
    # Upload the file.
    When I click the "Media browser" button in the "edit-body-und-0-value" WYSIWYG editor
      And I switch to the frame 1
      And I attach the file "test-sm.png" to "files[upload]"
      And I press "Next"
    Then I should see "Destination"
    # Select the destination (public/private files).
    When I select the radio button "Public local files served by the webserver."
      And I press "Next"
      And I wait 2 seconds
    Then I should see a "#edit-submit" element
      And I should see the "Crop" button
    # Fields for the image.
    When I fill in the following:
        | Alt Text   | Sample alt text   |
        | Title Text | Sample title text |
      And I press "Save"
    # The media style selector.
    When I wait 2 seconds
      And I switch to the frame 1
      And I select "Quarter Size" from "format"
    Then the "Alt Text" field should contain "Sample Alt text"
      And the "Title Text" field should contain "Sample Title text"
      And I click the fake "Submit" button
      And I switch out of all frames
    # Save the whole node.
    #When I press "Publish"
    When I press "edit-submit"
    # See the image on the view page.
    Then I should see the "img" element in the "Bryant Content" region
      And I should see the image alt "Sample alt text" in the "Bryant Content" region

  # TODO: About 10% of the time this test will hang with Firefox, so for now,
