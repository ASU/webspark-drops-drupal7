INTRODUCTION
------------

The Easy Breadcrumb module provides configurable breadcrumbs that improve on
core breadcrumbs by including the current page title as an unlinked crumb which
follows breadcrumb best-practices
(URL "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/breadcrumb-navigation-useful/").

Easy Breadcrumb takes advantage of the work you've already done for generating
your path aliases, while it naturally encourages the creation of semantic
and consistent paths. This module is currently available for Drupal 6.x, 7.x,
and 8.x.x.

Easy Breadcrumb uses the current URL (path alias) and the current page's title
to automatically extract the breadcrumb's segments and its respective links.
The module is really a plug and play module because it auto-generates the
breadcrumb by using the current URL and nothing extra is needed.
