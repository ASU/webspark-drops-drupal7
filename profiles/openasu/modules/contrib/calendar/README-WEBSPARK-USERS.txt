** Calendar module removal from Webspark **

This module's functionality has been removed from Webspark as of the Sioux Falls release, but in order to avoid a Git CONFLICT 
issue for end users this directory and its remaining empty files will be removed completely in a future release.

Any Webspark users that want to use the Calendar module need to leave this directory and its contents alone and instead 
add the module to sites/all/modules/contrib.
