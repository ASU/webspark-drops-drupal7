Missing Modules
===============

This module lists modules that are activated in your database but missing
from your file system.

These can greatly impact the performance of your Drupal 7 site. For example: 1 missing module load
to 900 file_scan_directory() calls results in a wasted 250ms with every page load!

INSTALL
===============

This module can be installed as any other Drupal module, or as a drush module in e.g. ~/.drush/.

USAGE
===============

After enabling the module, go to the site status report at /admin/reports/status to see the list
of missing modules.

If there are any missing modules listed, they'll have the following options:

  * Disable - Simply disables the missing module. This does not remove the
      missing module's superfluous record from the system table, and it does not remove any
      lingering tables and/or data generated from the database (especially if the module had an
      .install file containing hook_install and hook_uninstall function calls).
  * Remove - Removes the missing module record from the database's system table.
      This does not remove any lingering database tables and/or data created by the module.
  * Download from drupal.org - Re-download the module and replace it in the directory reported
      at /admin/modules/status. If the module is no longer desired, 1) disable it at
      /admin/modules if it's still enabled, 2) uninstall it at /admin/modules/uninstall if it's on
      that page's uninstall list (to delete any lingering database tables and/or data generated by the
      module,) and then re-delete the module code. (If the missing module had an .install file,
      then this is the best option.)

** Drush commands are also available:

* drush list-missing-modules (alias: drush lmm) - Lists the missing modules incorrectly referenced in the DB.
* drush remove-missing-modules (alias: drush rmm) - Deletes entries in the `system` DB table and removes them
  from this list.
