Webspark Jumbohero - 7.x-1.8, 2021-01-17
------------------------------
- Updated font-weight from 900 to 700 for bold output to keep Windows-based browsers from implementing
  the Arial Black font (and break Web standards 2.0).

Webspark Jumbohero - 7.x-1.7, 2019-12-30
------------------------------
- All form field outputs are now sanitized before rendering. (This is mitigated in that only Drupal users with privileges
  to create and save heroes and jumbo heroes could exploit this vulnerability)
- Bylines/blurbs are no longer truncated automatically with an ellipsis and limited to one line

Webspark Jumbohero - 7.x-1.6, 2019-08-02
------------------------------
- Improved mouseover description when a link to create an ASU spotlight is rendered in the In-Page Editor

Webspark Jumbohero - 7.x-1.4, 2018-01-31
------------------------------
- Added ellipsis to long image blurbs/taglines to fix mobile layout issues
- Added SASS files for all future CSS development
- Updated most element and font units from px to em or rem
