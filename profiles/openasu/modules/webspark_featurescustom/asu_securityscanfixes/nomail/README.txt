When enabled, this module does one thing: block Drupal from sending any email.

In ASU's context, it should be enabled when security scans are being run by the Internet Security Office (ISO).

NOTE: Emails that are blocked by this module are not queued; They are lost forever. If rerouting of emails 
is desired, a better option may be the Reroute Email module (https://www.drupal.org/project/reroute_email).
