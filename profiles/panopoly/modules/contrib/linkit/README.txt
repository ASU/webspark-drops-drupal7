INTRODUCTION
============

Linkit provides an easy interface for internal linking. Linkit links to
nodes, users, managed files and terms by default, using an autocomplete field.
Linkit has two major advantages over traditional linking

 1. The user does not have to copy or remember a URL
 2. If the target node changes it's alias (e.g. if the node's menu item
    title is changed) the link will remain functional.

See http://drupal.org/project/linkit for more information
